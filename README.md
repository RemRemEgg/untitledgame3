# untitledgame3
Hello! this game is a small project im working on where im trying to make as much of the game as possible be procedurally generated. right now i have systems setup for procedural levels, enemies, and items. planning on adding music and graphics to that list, but first things first

i dont always have a lot of free time and motivation, so development is slow. if you have any ideas feel free to reach me @`remremegg` on discord
